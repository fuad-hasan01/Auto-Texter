# Auto-Texter

This Python Auto Texter project is a simple automation tool that sends repeated text messages automatically using the pyautogui library. It can be used to simulate typing or send bulk messages for testing and learning automation concepts. Although it can behave like a spam bot, it is created strictly for educational and experimental purposes only â€” to understand Python automation and keyboard control.
